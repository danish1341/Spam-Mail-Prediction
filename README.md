# Spam-Mail-Prediction

In today's digital age, tackling spam emails is crucial for efficient communication starting from small organizations to the large estabished organisations. With that in mind, I dove into building a spam filter using Natural Language Processing and Support Vector Machines.

# Project Overview:
Leveraged Python's Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn libraries for data manipulation, preprocessing, and model implementation.
Trained a Linear Support Vector Classifier on a dataset containing spam and ham emails.
Utilized TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text data into numerical features.
Achieved an impressive accuracy of [insert accuracy score] on both training and test datasets.

# Key Takeaways:
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, removed unnecessary null values, and transformed text data into a format suitable for machine learning models.
Model Training: Implemented a Linear Support Vector Classifier, known for its effectiveness in text classification tasks.
Evaluation: Assessed model performance using accuracy metrics, ensuring reliable predictions.
